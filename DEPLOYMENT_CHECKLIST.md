## üîß Setup Commands

### Quick Setup Script
```bash
# Run the interactive setup wizard
cd chm/scripts
python setup_external_services.py interactive

# Or run individual commands
python setup_external_services.py update-username YOUR_USERNAME
python setup_external_services.py validate-urls
python setup_external_services.py check-secrets
python setup_external_services.py generate-secrets-script
```

### Manual Setup
```bash
# Update GitHub username in all files
find . -type f -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.md" | xargs sed -i 's/username/YOUR_USERNAME/g'

# Set up GitHub secrets (if you have gh CLI)
gh secret set SNYK_TOKEN --body "your-snyk-token"
gh secret set CODECOV_TOKEN --body "your-codecov-token"
gh secret set CODACY_PROJECT_TOKEN --body "your-codacy-token"

# Test the pipeline
git add .
git commit -m "Configure external services for badges"
git push origin main
```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Local Testing
- [ ] Run `make test` - All tests pass
- [ ] Run `make lint` - No linting errors
- [ ] Run `make security` - Security scans pass
- [ ] Run `make docs` - Documentation builds successfully
- [ ] Run `make quality-score` - Quality score calculated

### CI/CD Pipeline Testing
- [ ] Push to `main` branch triggers workflow
- [ ] All jobs complete successfully
- [ ] Coverage reports generated and uploaded
- [ ] Security scans complete without errors
- [ ] Performance tests pass
- [ ] Documentation quality checks pass
- [ ] Quality score calculation completes

### Badge Verification
- [ ] Build status badge shows current status
- [ ] Code coverage badge displays percentage
- [ ] Code quality badge shows grade
- [ ] Security badge shows status
- [ ] All badges link to correct reports
- [ ] Badges update automatically with new commits

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Badge Not Displaying
**Problem:** Badge shows as broken image or placeholder
**Solutions:**
- Verify service is properly configured
- Check if repository is public
- Ensure API tokens are valid
- Verify badge URLs are accessible

### Workflow Failures
**Problem:** GitHub Actions workflow fails
**Solutions:**
- Check GitHub Secrets are properly configured
- Verify API tokens are not expired
- Check service-specific error logs
- Ensure all required files exist

### Coverage Not Updating
**Problem:** Code coverage badge shows old data
**Solutions:**
- Verify Codecov token is correct
- Check if coverage reports are being generated
- Ensure coverage file path is correct in workflow
- Wait for Codecov to process reports (can take a few minutes)

### Security Scan Failures
**Problem:** Security scanning jobs fail
**Solutions:**
- Check Snyk token is valid
- Verify repository has access to Snyk
- Check if dependencies are accessible
- Review Snyk-specific error messages

## üìä Expected Results

After successful deployment, you should see:

### Badges Displaying
- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Green (passing) or ‚ùå Red (failing)
- **Code Coverage:** Percentage (e.g., 95%)
- **Code Quality:** Grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
- **Security:** Status (e.g., "No known vulnerabilities")
- **License:** MIT license badge

### Reports Accessible
- **Codecov:** Detailed coverage reports with line-by-line analysis
- **Codacy:** Code quality analysis with specific recommendations
- **Snyk:** Security vulnerability reports with remediation steps
- **GitHub Actions:** Complete CI/CD pipeline logs and artifacts

### Automated Updates
- Badges update automatically with each commit
- Coverage percentages reflect current code state
- Quality grades update based on latest analysis
- Security status reflects current vulnerability state

## üîÑ Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Daily Checks (First Week)
- [ ] Verify all badges are displaying
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions workflow status
- [ ] Monitor external service status
- [ ] Verify badge accuracy

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Review coverage trends
- [ ] Check quality grade changes
- [ ] Monitor security scan results
- [ ] Review performance metrics

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] Verify API token validity
- [ ] Check service status and updates
- [ ] Review and update configurations
- [ ] Monitor badge performance

## üÜò Troubleshooting Commands

```bash
# Check workflow status
gh run list --workflow=ci-cd.yml

# View workflow logs
gh run view --log

# Check secrets (names only)
gh secret list

# Validate badge URLs
cd chm/scripts
python setup_external_services.py validate-urls

# Check required secrets
python setup_external_services.py check-secrets

# Generate setup commands
python setup_external_services.py generate-setup
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

The deployment is considered successful when:

1. **All required badges display correctly** with real-time data
2. **CI/CD pipeline runs successfully** on every push
3. **External services are properly integrated** and reporting
4. **Badges update automatically** with code changes
5. **All links point to correct reports** and dashboards
6. **Quality metrics are accurate** and up-to-date
