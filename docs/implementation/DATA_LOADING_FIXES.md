# CHM Data Loading Issues - Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve data loading issues in the CHM (Catalyst Health Monitoring) system.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. ✅ SNMP Timeout Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Short timeout values (1-3 seconds) causing frequent device polling failures.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **Discovery Service** (`backend/discovery/service.py`):
  - Increased timeout from 3s to 10s for device enhancement
  - Increased timeout from 2s to 8s for basic SNMP info
  - Increased timeout from 5s to 12s for device polling
  - Increased retries from 1-2 to 2-4 across all operations

- **SNMP Discovery** (`backend/discovery/snmp_discovery.py`):
  - Increased session timeout from 5s to 10s
  - Increased community discovery timeout from 3s to 8s
  - Increased retries from 1-2 to 2-3

- **SNMP Monitor** (`backend/collector/protocols/snmp/monitor.py`):
  - Increased default timeout from 3s to 10s
  - Increased default retries from 3 to 4

### 2. ✅ Database Connection Pool Improvements
**Problem**: Limited connection pool causing bottlenecks under load.

**Fixes Applied** (`backend/storage/database.py`):
- Increased pool size from default (5) to 20
- Added max_overflow of 30 connections
- Added pool_timeout of 30 seconds
- Added application name for better monitoring
- Added database health check method
- Added connection pool statistics method

### 3. ✅ Frontend API Timeout and Retry Logic
**Problem**: No timeout configuration and retry logic in frontend API calls.

**Fixes Applied** (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`):
- Added 30-second timeout for all API calls
- Implemented exponential backoff retry logic (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Added retry for network errors and 5xx server errors
- Limited retries to 3 attempts maximum

### 4. ✅ Background Task Resilience
**Problem**: Background tasks continued attempting to poll failing devices without circuit breaker protection.

**Fixes Applied** (`backend/services/background_tasks.py`):
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**:
  - Open circuit after 5 consecutive failures
  - Recovery timeout of 5 minutes
  - Half-open state with max 3 calls
  - Device-specific failure tracking

- **Dynamic Polling Intervals**:
  - Base interval: 60 seconds
  - Increased interval when many devices are failing
  - Skip devices with open circuit breakers

### 5. ✅ Data Collection Optimization
**Problem**: Sequential device polling causing slow collection and potential timeouts.

**Fixes Applied** (`backend/services/background_tasks.py`):
- **Batch Processing**:
  - Process devices in configurable batches (default: 20)
  - Concurrent processing within batches
  - Small delays between batches to prevent system overload

- **Concurrency Control**:
  - Semaphore limiting concurrent collections (default: 10)
  - Environment variable configuration:
    - `MAX_CONCURRENT_COLLECTIONS` (default: 10)
    - `COLLECTION_BATCH_SIZE` (default: 20)

### 6. ✅ Enhanced Health Monitoring
**Problem**: Limited visibility into system health and connection issues.

**Fixes Applied** (`backend/api/main.py`):
- Enhanced `/api/v1/health` endpoint with:
  - Database connection health check
  - Database connection pool statistics
  - Background service status
  - Circuit breaker statistics (open/half-open circuits)
  - Overall system health status

## Configuration Environment Variables

Add these environment variables for optimal performance:

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://healthmon:password@localhost:5432/healthmonitor

# SNMP Configuration
DEFAULT_SNMP_TIMEOUT=10
DEFAULT_SNMP_RETRIES=3

# Data Collection Configuration
MAX_CONCURRENT_COLLECTIONS=10
COLLECTION_BATCH_SIZE=20

# Circuit Breaker Configuration (hardcoded, can be made configurable)
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=5
CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT=300
```

## Performance Improvements Expected

### 1. SNMP Operations
- **Before**: 1-3 second timeouts causing frequent failures
- **After**: 8-12 second timeouts with exponential backoff
- **Expected**: 60-80% reduction in timeout-related failures

### 2. Database Connections
- **Before**: Limited pool size causing connection exhaustion
- **After**: 20 base connections + 30 overflow
- **Expected**: 90% reduction in connection timeout errors

### 3. Data Collection
- **Before**: Sequential device polling
- **After**: Concurrent batch processing with circuit breakers
- **Expected**: 3-5x faster collection for large device counts

### 4. System Resilience
- **Before**: Continuous polling of failing devices
- **After**: Circuit breaker protection with automatic recovery
- **Expected**: Reduced system load and faster recovery from failures

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Check Endpoint
Monitor system health via: `GET /api/v1/health`

Response includes:
- Database connection status
- Connection pool statistics
- Circuit breaker states
- Background service status

### Log Monitoring
Watch for these improved log messages:
- Circuit breaker state changes
- Batch processing statistics
- Timeout and retry operations
- Database connection health

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. **Circuit Breaker States**: Open/half-open circuits indicate problematic devices
2. **Database Pool Usage**: Monitor connection pool utilization
3. **Collection Performance**: Batch completion times and success rates
4. **SNMP Timeout Rates**: Should decrease significantly

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert these changes by:
1. Restoring original timeout values (1-3 seconds)
2. Removing circuit breaker logic
3. Reverting to sequential device processing
4. Using default database connection pool settings

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Load Testing**: Test with large numbers of devices (100+)
2. **Network Issues**: Test with devices that have intermittent connectivity
3. **Database Load**: Test under high concurrent load
4. **Recovery Testing**: Test circuit breaker recovery after device fixes

## Files Modified

1. `backend/discovery/service.py` - SNMP timeout improvements
2. `backend/discovery/snmp_discovery.py` - Discovery timeout improvements  
3. `backend/collector/protocols/snmp/monitor.py` - Monitor timeout improvements
4. `backend/storage/database.py` - Connection pool and health checks
5. `backend/services/background_tasks.py` - Circuit breakers and batch processing
6. `backend/api/main.py` - Enhanced health endpoint and missing imports
7. `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Timeout and retry logic

These fixes should significantly improve the reliability and performance of data loading operations in CHM.
